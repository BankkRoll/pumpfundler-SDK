# Configuring Pumpfundler SDK

Proper configuration is crucial for the optimal performance of Pumpfundler SDK. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and configuring the SDK for your Solana project.

## Basic Configuration

To start using Pumpfundler SDK, you need to create a `PumpfundlerConfig` object and initialize the SDK. Here's a basic example:

```typescript
import { Connection, Keypair } from "@solana/web3.js";
import { PumpfundlerSDK, PumpfundlerConfig } from "pumpfundler-sdk";
import { AnchorProvider, Wallet } from "@coral-xyz/anchor";

const connection = new Connection("https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com");
const wallet = new Wallet(Keypair.generate());

const config: PumpfundlerConfig = {
  connection,
  jitoFee: 1000000, // 0.001 SOL
  commitmentLevel: "confirmed",
  blockEngineUrl: "https://your-jito-block-engine-url.com",
  jitoAuthKeypair: "your-jito-auth-keypair-base58",
};

const provider = new AnchorProvider(connection, wallet, {});
const sdk = new PumpfundlerSDK(provider, config);
```

## Configuration Options

Let's break down the configuration options:

<Accordion title="connection">
  This is a Solana `Connection` object that specifies which Solana cluster to connect to. You can use mainnet, testnet, or devnet depending on your development stage.

  ```typescript
  const connection = new Connection("https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com");
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="jitoFee">
  The fee (in lamports) to be paid for Jito MEV protection. In the example, it's set to 0.001 SOL (1,000,000 lamports).

  ```typescript
  jitoFee: 1000000, // 0.001 SOL
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="commitmentLevel">
  Specifies the commitment level for transactions. Options include:
  - `"processed"`
  - `"confirmed"`
  - `"finalized"`

  ```typescript
  commitmentLevel: "confirmed",
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="blockEngineUrl">
  The URL of the Jito block engine. This is required for MEV protection features.

  ```typescript
  blockEngineUrl: "https://your-jito-block-engine-url.com",
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="jitoAuthKeypair">
  The base58-encoded private key for Jito authentication. This is required for secure communication with the Jito block engine.

  ```typescript
  jitoAuthKeypair: "your-jito-auth-keypair-base58",
  ```
</Accordion>

## Advanced Configuration

For more advanced use cases, you can also configure:

### Custom RPC Endpoints

If you're using a custom RPC endpoint, you can specify it when creating the `Connection`:

```typescript
const connection = new Connection("https://your-custom-rpc-endpoint.com");
```

### Provider Options

You can pass additional options to the `AnchorProvider`:

```typescript
const provider = new AnchorProvider(connection, wallet, {
  preflightCommitment: "processed",
  commitment: "confirmed",
});
```

## Environment-Specific Configuration

It's a good practice to use different configurations for development, testing, and production environments. You can use environment variables to manage this:

```typescript
const config: PumpfundlerConfig = {
  connection: new Connection(process.env.SOLANA_RPC_URL),
  jitoFee: process.env.JITO_FEE ? parseInt(process.env.JITO_FEE) : 1000000,
  commitmentLevel: process.env.COMMITMENT_LEVEL || "confirmed",
  blockEngineUrl: process.env.JITO_BLOCK_ENGINE_URL,
  jitoAuthKeypair: process.env.JITO_AUTH_KEYPAIR,
};
```

## Configuration Best Practices

<Check>Use environment variables for sensitive information like RPC URLs and auth keys</Check>
<Check>Set appropriate commitment levels based on your application's needs</Check>
<Check>Adjust Jito fees based on network congestion and your MEV protection requirements</Check>
<Check>Use custom RPC endpoints for better performance and reliability in production</Check>
