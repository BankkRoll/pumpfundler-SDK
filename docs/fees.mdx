PumpFundler SDK implements two primary types of fees:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Creation Fee" icon="coins">
    0.01 SOL per token creation
  </Card>
  <Card title="Transaction Fee" icon="receipt">
    1% of the transaction amount
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Detailed Fee Explanation

### Token Creation Fee

When you create a new token using the PumpFundler SDK, a flat fee of 0.01 SOL is charged. This fee is applied regardless of the token's parameters.

### Transaction Fee

For each transaction (buy or sell) executed through the SDK, a fee of 1% of the transaction amount is charged. This fee is collected in the same token or SOL that is being transacted.

## Fee Calculation

### Creation Fee
The creation fee is a fixed amount of 0.01 SOL, which is equivalent to 10,000,000 lamports.

### Transaction Fee
The transaction fee is calculated as 1% of the transaction amount. For example:
- If you're buying 100 SOL worth of tokens, the fee would be 1 SOL.
- If you're selling tokens worth 50 SOL, the fee would be 0.5 SOL.
