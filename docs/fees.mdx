PumpFundler SDK implements two primary types of fees:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Creation Fee" icon="coins">
    0.01 SOL per token creation
  </Card>
  <Card title="Transaction Fee" icon="receipt">
    1% of the transaction amount
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Detailed Fee Explanation

### Token Creation Fee

When you create a new token using the PumpFundler SDK, a flat fee of 0.01 SOL is charged. This fee is applied regardless of the token's parameters.

```typescript
export const CREATION_FEE = BigInt(0.01 * LAMPORTS_PER_SOL);
```

### Transaction Fee

For each transaction (buy or sell) executed through the SDK, a fee of 1% of the transaction amount is charged. This fee is collected in the same token or SOL that is being transacted.

```typescript
export const TRANSACTION_FEE_PERCENT = 0.01;
```

## Fee Calculation

### Creation Fee
The creation fee is a fixed amount of 0.01 SOL, which is equivalent to 10,000,000 lamports.

### Transaction Fee
The transaction fee is calculated as 1% of the transaction amount. For example:
- If you're buying 100 SOL worth of tokens, the fee would be 1 SOL.
- If you're selling tokens worth 50 SOL, the fee would be 0.5 SOL.

```typescript
export const calculateTransactionFee = (
  dataSize: bigint | undefined,
): bigint => {
  if (dataSize === undefined) {
    return BigInt(0);
  }
  return BigInt(Math.floor(Number(dataSize) * TRANSACTION_FEE_PERCENT));
};
```

## Fee Implementation

Fees are implemented in the SDK as follows:

1. **Creation Fee**: Applied in the `createAndBuy` method of the `PumpFundlerSDK` class.

```typescript
const creationFeeTx = createFeeInstruction(creator.publicKey, CREATION_FEE);
const newTx = new Transaction().add(creationFeeTx).add(createTx);
```

2. **Transaction Fee**: Applied in the `buy` and `sell` methods.

```typescript
const fee = calculateTransactionFee(buyAmountSol);
const buyAmountAfterFee = buyAmountSol - fee;
const feeTx = createFeeInstruction(buyer.publicKey, fee);
```

## Transparency and Updates

We are committed to maintaining transparency in our fee structure. Any changes to our fees will be communicated well in advance through our official channels and updated in this documentation.

## Examples

Here are some examples to illustrate how the fees are applied:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Creating a New Token">
    - Token Creation Fee: 0.01 SOL
    - Total Cost: 0.01 SOL

    ```typescript
    const createTx = await sdk.getCreateInstructions(/* ... */);
    const creationFeeTx = createFeeInstruction(creator.publicKey, CREATION_FEE);
    const newTx = new Transaction().add(creationFeeTx).add(createTx);
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Creating and Buying with Multiple Wallets">
    - Token Creation Fee: 0.01 SOL (paid by the creator)
    - Transaction Fee: 0 SOL (no transaction fee for initial buys in createAndBuy)
    - Total Cost: 0.01 SOL (regardless of the number of buyers)

    ```typescript
    const creator = localWallets[0];
    const mint = Keypair.generate();
    const buyers = localWallets.slice(1);
    const buyAmountSol = BigInt(1_000_000_000); // 1 SOL per buyer

    const result = await sdk.createAndBuy(
      creator,
      mint,
      buyers,
      metadata,
      buyAmountSol * BigInt(buyers.length),
      300n, // 3% slippage
      undefined, // No priority fees
      "confirmed",
      "finalized"
    );
    // Only the creation fee of 0.01 SOL is charged here
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Buying Tokens">
    - Transaction Amount: 100 SOL
    - Transaction Fee: 1 SOL (1% of 100 SOL)
    - Total Cost: 101 SOL

    ```typescript
    const buyAmountSol = BigInt(100 * LAMPORTS_PER_SOL);
    const fee = calculateTransactionFee(buyAmountSol);
    const buyAmountAfterFee = buyAmountSol - fee;
    const buyTx = await sdk.getBuyInstructionsBySolAmount(/* ... */);
    const feeTx = createFeeInstruction(buyer.publicKey, fee);
    const combinedTx = new Transaction().add(feeTx).add(buyTx);
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Selling Tokens">
    - Transaction Amount: 50 SOL worth of tokens
    - Transaction Fee: 0.5 SOL (1% of 50 SOL)
    - Net Received: 49.5 SOL

    ```typescript
    const sellTx = await sdk.getSellInstructionsByTokenAmount(/* ... */);
    // Fee is calculated and deducted after the sell transaction is confirmed
    if (sellResults.success && sellResults.results?.meta) {
      const soldAmount = postBalance - preBalance;
      if (soldAmount > 0) {
        const fee = calculateTransactionFee(BigInt(soldAmount));
        const feeTx = createFeeInstruction(seller.publicKey, fee);
        await sendTx(/* ... */);
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Advanced Fee Considerations

### Slippage and Fees

When setting slippage tolerance for buy and sell operations, consider the impact of fees:

```typescript
const slippageBasisPoints = 500n; // 5% slippage tolerance
const buyAmountWithSlippage = calculateWithSlippageBuy(buyAmountSol, slippageBasisPoints);
const sellAmountWithSlippage = calculateWithSlippageSell(minSolOutput, slippageBasisPoints);
```

### Jito Fees

When using Jito for MEV protection, additional fees apply:

```typescript
const jitoConfig = {
  jitoAuthKeypair: "your_base58_encoded_jito_auth_keypair",
  jitoFee: 10000, // in lamports
};
```

These fees are separate from the PumpFundler SDK fees and are paid to Jito for their services.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why is there a creation fee?">
    The creation fee supports the development and maintenance of the SDK and the PumpFun protocol infrastructure.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is the transaction fee the same for buying and selling?">
    Yes, the transaction fee is consistently 1% of the transaction amount, whether you're buying or selling tokens.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Are there any additional network fees?">
    The fees mentioned here are specific to the PumpFundler SDK. Solana network fees (which are typically very low) will also apply to transactions. If you're using Jito integration, additional Jito fees will apply.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How are fees handled in the createAndBuy function?">
    In the `createAndBuy` function, only the creation fee of 0.01 SOL is charged, regardless of the number of buyers or the amount of tokens purchased. This fee is paid by the creator. The initial buys executed as part of `createAndBuy` do not incur the usual 1% transaction fee. Subsequent buy and sell operations will be subject to the standard 1% transaction fee.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How are fees handled in other multi-wallet operations?">
    For operations other than `createAndBuy`, such as multiple separate `buy` transactions, each transaction would incur its own 1% fee. The creation fee is only charged once per token creation.
  </Accordion>

## Best Practices

1. **Fee Estimation**: Always estimate fees before executing transactions to ensure sufficient balance.
2. **User Communication**: Clearly communicate fee structures to your users, especially in UI implementations.
3. **Fee Optimization**: For large operations, consider batching transactions to optimize fee costs.
4. **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor fee expenditures to optimize your application's cost structure.

By understanding and properly implementing the fee structure, you can ensure smooth operations and transparent pricing for your users when integrating the PumpFundler SDK.
