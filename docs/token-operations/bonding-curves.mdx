# Bonding Curves

Bonding curves are a fundamental concept in the PumpFundler protocol, governing the relationship between token supply and price. This guide provides an in-depth look at how bonding curves work in the PumpFundler ecosystem and how to interact with them using the SDK.

## Understanding Bonding Curves

A bonding curve is a mathematical function that defines the relationship between a token's price and its supply. In the PumpFundler protocol, we use a specific type of bonding curve known as a "constant product" curve.

### Key Concepts

1. **Virtual Reserves**: These are used to calculate the price but don't represent actual assets.
2. **Real Reserves**: These represent the actual assets (SOL and tokens) in the pool.
3. **Constant Product Formula**: The product of virtual SOL reserves and virtual token reserves remains constant.

## Bonding Curve Mathematics

The core formula for our bonding curve is:

```
virtualSolReserves * virtualTokenReserves = constant
```

When buying or selling tokens, we adjust the virtual reserves to maintain this constant product.

### Buying Tokens

When buying tokens, we increase the virtual SOL reserves and decrease the virtual token reserves:

```typescript
const newVirtualSolReserves = virtualSolReserves + solAmount;
const newVirtualTokenReserves = constant / newVirtualSolReserves;
const tokensBought = virtualTokenReserves - newVirtualTokenReserves;
```

### Selling Tokens

When selling tokens, we decrease the virtual SOL reserves and increase the virtual token reserves:

```typescript
const newVirtualTokenReserves = virtualTokenReserves + tokenAmount;
const newVirtualSolReserves = constant / newVirtualTokenReserves;
const solReceived = virtualSolReserves - newVirtualSolReserves;
```

## Implementing Bonding Curves in the SDK

The PumpFundler SDK encapsulates bonding curve logic in the `AMM` (Automated Market Maker) class. Let's explore how to work with this class.

### Creating an AMM Instance

```typescript
import { AMM, BondingCurveAccount } from "pumpfundler-sdk";

const amm = AMM.fromBondingCurveAccount(
  bondingCurveAccount,
  globalAccount.initialVirtualTokenReserves
);
```

### Calculating Buy Price

To calculate the price for buying a specific amount of tokens:

```typescript
const tokensToBuy = BigInt(1000 * 10**9); // 1000 tokens (assuming 9 decimals)
const solNeeded = amm.getBuyPrice(tokensToBuy);
console.log(`SOL needed to buy \${tokensToBuy} tokens: \${solNeeded}`);
```

### Calculating Sell Price

To calculate the SOL received for selling a specific amount of tokens:

```typescript
const tokensToSell = BigInt(1000 * 10**9); // 1000 tokens (assuming 9 decimals)
const solReceived = amm.getSellPrice(tokensToSell);
console.log(`SOL received for selling \${tokensToSell} tokens: \${solReceived}`);
```

### Simulating Trades

You can simulate trades to see how they would affect the bonding curve:

```typescript
const buyResult = amm.applyBuy(tokensToBuy);
console.log(`Simulated buy: \${buyResult.token_amount} tokens for \${buyResult.sol_amount} SOL`);

const sellResult = amm.applySell(tokensToSell);
console.log(`Simulated sell: \${sellResult.token_amount} tokens for \${sellResult.sol_amount} SOL`);
```
